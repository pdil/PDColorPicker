# PDColorPicker Contribution Guidelines

**PDColorPicker** welcomes contributions by anyone who is willing and abides by the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/pdil/PDColorPicker/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). The following guidelines provide a framework to make contribution seamless and effective.

### Pull Requests
The main way to contribute to **PDColorPicker** is via pull requests. 
The steps to follow to submit a pull request are as follows:

1. Fork **PDColorPicker**
2. Clone your forked repository to your computer
3. Make changes and commits
4. Push your changes and commits to GitHub
5. Submit a pull request to this repository

Your changes will be reviewed and discussed. Then the pull request will either be accepted, or sent back for changes. If it is determined that the change is not appropriate for the project, it may be rejected.

#### Branch Structure
All commits should be done on the `develop` branch. `master` is only to be used when a new release is being pushed. If the feature or bugfix requires significant work, create a separate branch to perform the work, then merge to `develop`.

### Issues
Another way to contribute is filing issues. To file an issue go to the Issues tab and click "New issue". If possible, categorize your issue using one of the pre-defined labels. Issues offer a way to discuss bugs or proposed changes. If you are unable to submit a pull request with changes, an issue is a good way to bring that change proposal to the attention of the project maintainers and contributers.
