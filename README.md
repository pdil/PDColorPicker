üé® **PDColorPicker** is an open source iOS library that lets developers include a color picker in their apps, allowing users to easily select colors in a variety of formats. This library is open for collaboration with the community so anyone is invited to submit issues or pull requests.

## üìÑ Requirements

* iOS 9.0 or later (iOS 11.0+ for drag and drop)
* Xcode 10.2 or later
* Swift 5 or later

## üíª Installation

### Cocoapods

`PDColorPicker` is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org).

If you have not done so already, run `pod setup` from the root directory of your application.

To install `PDColorPicker`, simply add the following line to the Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'PDColorPicker'
```

This line should be added to the app's target so that it looks something like this:

```ruby
use_frameworks!

target 'TARGET_NAME' do
  pod 'PDColorPicker'

  # other pods...
end
```

> **Older Swift Versions**
>
> If the project is not built for Swift 4.2, install from the `swift-3.2`, `swift-4.1` or the `swift-4.2` branches:
> ```ruby
> pod 'PDColorPicker', :git => 'https://github.com/pdil/PDColorPicker.git', :branch => 'swift-4.2'
> ```
> Note that this build may not include all of the latest features of `PDColorPicker`.

Build the CocoaPods frameworks by running the following command in the Terminal from the root project directory:

```
$ pod install
```

Open the newly created `.xcworkspace` file and build the project to make `PDColorPicker` available.

**Note**: Be sure to always work inside the `.xcworkspace` file and **not** the `.xcodeproj` file, otherwise Xcode will not be able to locate the dependencies and `PDColorPicker` will not be accessible.

### Carthage

`PDColorPicker` is available through [Carthage](https://github.com/carthage/carthage).

If you haven't installed Carthage yet, use Homebrew to install it:

```
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

Create a Cartfile inside the root project directory with the following line (or add this line if you already have a Cartfile):

```
github "pdil/PDColorPicker"
```

> **Older Swift Versions**
>
> If the project is not built for Swift 4.2, install from the `swift-3.2`, `swift-4.1` or the `swift-4.2` branches:
> ```
> github "pdil/PDColorPicker" "swift-4.2"
> ```
> Note that this build may not include the latest features of `PDColorPicker`.

Build the Carthage frameworks by running the following command in the Terminal from the root project directory:

```
$ carthage update
```

This will build the framework inside the `Carthage/build` folder.

Lastly, add the framework to your project:

* In Xcode, select the project in the Project Navigator in Xcode (blue icon).
* Open the "General" tab on the top bar.
* Drag `PDColorPicker.framework` from the `Carthage/build` folder into the "Embedded Binaries" section.

### Manual (not recommended)

* Download the `.swift` files inside [PDColorPicker/Classes](https://github.com/pdil/PDColorPicker/tree/master/PDColorPicker/Classes) and add them to your project.
* Add the files to the appropriate target(s) within the project.
* Import `PDColorPicker` as you normally would.

## üìù Usage

```swift
import UIKit
import PDColorPicker  // 1.

class MyViewController: UIViewController, Dimmable {
    // ...
  
    func presentColorPicker() {
        // 2.
        let colorPickerVC = PDColorPickerViewController(initialColor: .blue, tintColor: .black)

        // 3.
        colorPickerVC.completion = {
            [weak self] newColor in

            self?.undim() // 7.

            guard let color = newColor else {
                print("The user tapped cancel, no color was selected.")
                return
            }

            print("A new color was selected! HSBA: \(String(describing: color))")
         }
  
         // 4.
         dim() // see Dimmable documentation for extra options
    
         // 5.
         present(colorPickerVC, animated: true)
    }
  
    // ...
}
```

1. Import the  `PDColorPicker` framework.
2. Instantiate a new `PDColorPickerViewController`.
3. Set the completion handler of the color picker, indicating what the presenting view controller should do with the color result. **Note**: this can also be set in the `PDColorPickerViewController` initializer.
4. Implement the `Dimmable` protocol and dim the presenting view controller (optional but highly recommended).
5. Present the color picker as a modal view controller.
6. Use the color picker to select a color. When **Save** or **Cancel** is tapped, the completion handler specified in the initializer will automatically provide the new color. If the user taps cancel, `nil` is returned.
7. Be sure to undim the view once the completion handler is called.

### Bonus

To achieve the white status bar while the presenting view controller is dimmed, set `UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance` to `YES` in your `Info.plist`.

You can also copy the code here into the plist file:
```
<key>UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance</key>
<true/>
```

## üì≤ Drag and Drop

Drag and drop is also supported in projects that target iOS 11.0 or later.

[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pdil/PDColorPicker/master/Resources/drag-drop-demo.gif" width=600>](https://giphy.com/gifs/6TNPgdZ3W4qMo/fullscreen)

See `PDColorReceiverExample` for an example on how to consume a color that is dragged into your app. The drag and drop implementation of `PDColorPicker` exposes a basic `UIColor` so that it can be read by apps that don't necessarily import `PDColorPicker`.

Of course, if the destination app imports `PDColorPicker`, it will have access to the convenient `PDColor` class which it could instantiate with the received `UIColor`:

```swift
func dropInteraction(_ interaction: UIDropInteraction, performDrop session: UIDropSession) {
  session.loadObjects(ofClass: UIColor.self) {
    guard let color = $0.first as? UIColor else { return }

    let pdColor = PDColor(color: color)
    print(pdColor.hex)
  }
}
```

## üé® `PDColorPicker` in other apps
Here is a list of apps that use **PDColorPicker** to let their users select colors:

* üåÆ [FoodEase](https://foodease.xyz)
* üé®¬†[Paint Shapes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/paint-shapes/id1366164052)

If your app is using **PDColorPicker**, [let me know](mailto:dilorenzo@hey.com?subject=PDColorPicker) and I'll add it to this list (include an emoji to represent your app in the list, the app name, and a web or download URL)!
